                    Hello World. I have made this website after observing the
                    world connecting too rapidly but still having some diversity
                    in the range of services offered by the companies. So to
                    cope up with the fast changing world, I hereby like you to
                    introduce to LeoMalay which is a compilation of all the
                    services offered over the internet. From Shopping to Paying,
                    From Social Media to Cafeteria, From Yesterday to Tomorrow.
                    I plan on developing all the services from scratch.
                </p>

                <p className="AlignCenter title bold">Why</p>
                <p className="AlignJustify fs7 bold">
                    I am developing all of this services, as I will be able to
                    learn how to manage such a large project and will be able to
                    learn many different things. I am using ReactJS for the
                    Front-End and ExpressJS along with MongoDB as a database for
                    the BackEnd. I am also planning on developing all the mobile
                    apps for the services and products available on the website.
